### 🛡️ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack** using ARP Poisoning. We developed a custom Python tool (`mitm_attack.py`) that leverages the **Scapy** library to intercept traffic between a Windows 11 victim and a pfSense gateway within a virtualized Proxmox environment.

The tool performs the following automated actions:
1.  **IP Forwarding:** Automatically enables Linux kernel IP forwarding to maintain the victim's internet connection.
2.  **ARP Spoofing:** Floods the victim's ARP cache to redirect traffic through the attacker machine.
3.  **Packet Sniffing:** Analyzes TCP traffic in real-time to identify and capture unencrypted credentials (HTTP POST/GET data).

### 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
* `src/`: Contains the source code (`mitm_attack.py`).
* `docs/`: Contains the Final Project Report (PDF).
* `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the tool.
* `README.md`: Project documentation and usage guide.

### ⚙️ Setup & Installation

**Prerequisites**
* **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux (or any Linux distro with Root privileges)
* **Victim Machine:** Windows 10/11
* **Network:** Both machines must be on the same local subnet.
* **Python:** Python 3.x

**Installation Steps**
1.  Clone the repository to the attacker machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/NateT738/IT359GroupProject_ForcesOfNature.git](https://github.com/NateT738/IT359GroupProject_ForcesOfNature.git)
    cd IT359GroupProject_ForcesOfNature
    ```

2.  Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 🚀 Usage Guide

**1. Configuration**
Before running the tool, you must configure the target parameters. Open `src/mitm_attack.py` in a text editor:
```bash
nano src/mitm_attack.py

Update the following variables at the top of the file to match your specific lab environment:
- VICTIM_IP & VICTIM_MAC: The IP and MAC address of the target machine.
- GATEWAY_IP & GATEWAY_MAC: The IP and MAC address of the router/gateway.

**2. Execution**
Run the script with sudo permissions (required for raw packet injection):
sudo python3 src/mitm_attack.py

**3. Attack Verification**
- On the Victim Machine: Navigate to an HTTP website (e.g., http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php) and attempt to log in.
- On the Attacker Machine: Watch the terminal output. The script will intercept the HTTP POST request and display the captured username and password in plain text.

**4. Stopping The Attack**
Press CTRL+C to stop the script. The tool will automatically attempt to "heal" the network by sending correct ARP packets to restore the victim's connection to the router.
